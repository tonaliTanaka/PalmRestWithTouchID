# PalmRestWithTouchID

## Purpose of the 3D model

This 3D model is a case to use Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID as a palm rest. Touch ID is useful to unlock your passwords on Apple Silicon Mac. However, since Touch ID is only available on Apple Magic Keyboard, it is difficult to use other keyboard with Touch ID. Thus, I created a 3D case model to use Apple Magic Keyboard as a palm rest. Since the case has only a hole for a Touch ID key, you can make a palm rest with Touch ID using the case and Apple Magic Keyboard. The case allows you to use your favorite keyboard while using Touch ID.

## Materials

* Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID
* Filament for 3D printer
* Magnet (Diameter: 3 [mm], Thick: 1[mm])

## Example

I used the 3D printer, a 3D print slicer software filament, and magnets as below.

* CREALITY Ender-3 Pro (https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-pro-3d-printer)
* Ultimaker Cura (https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura)
* ANYCUBIC PLA Filament (https://www.anycubic.com/collections/pla/products/1-75mm-pla-3d-printer-filament?variant=41189469487266)
* Neodymium magnets (https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B08DXRWCPB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

In addition, __Standard Quality__ mode was used in Ultimaker Cura. 

After priting, the magnets were inserted into the printed palm rest. At this time, you should watch the direction of the magnets.
